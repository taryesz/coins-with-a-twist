# Problem description

A hat contains 100 coins, where 99 are fair but one is double-headed (always landing Heads).

A coin is chosen uniformly at random. The chosen coin is flipped 7 times, and it lands Heads all 7 times.

Given this information, what is the probability that the chosen coin is double-headed?

(Of course, another approach here would be to look at both sides of the coinâ€”but this is a metaphorical coin).
